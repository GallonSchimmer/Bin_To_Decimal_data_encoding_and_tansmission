This repository contains the Java implementation for a binary-to-decimal converter. The function takes a binary number in string format and converts it to its decimal integer form. It's a fundamental exercise for understanding bit manipulation and number system conversion, which are crucial in various fields of computing and electronic design.

## Problem Statement

Binary to decimal conversion is a fundamental concept in computer science, critical for understanding how computers interpret and store data. Given a binary number as a string, the task is to convert this number into its decimal form.


## Solution Concept

The converter tackles this problem by interpreting the binary string from right to left, calculating the power of 2 for each position and adding it to the result if the corresponding binary digit is '1'. The implementation utilizes the `Math.pow` function to handle the power calculations, ensuring precision in the conversion process.

## How It Works

The program reads a binary string, calculates the decimal value by iterating over each character of the string, and multiplies the appropriate power of 2 based on the position of the digit in the string (rightmost being the least significant digit).

## Learning Objectives

- **Binary Number System**: Gain an understanding of how binary numbers function and their pivotal role in computer systems.
- **Number Conversion**: Master the techniques for converting binary numbers into decimal numbers.
- **Looping and Conditionals in Java**: Enhance your ability to use control structures such as loops and conditional statements in Java to implement logical solutions.

## Practical Applications

- **Data Encoding and Transmission**: Understanding and implementing binary to decimal conversions are critical for encoding schemes used across computer networks and data transmission protocols.
- **Microcontroller Programming**: For programming microcontrollers and other embedded systems, manipulating binary data is essential for effective hardware interfacing.
- **Algorithmic Foundations**: This project serves as an introductory algorithm for students and professionals in computer science or software engineering, laying the groundwork for tackling more complex computational challenges.

## Algorithm Details

1. **Input Parsing**: Parse the binary input string from right to left to correctly align the powers of two.
2. **Calculation Loop**: Evaluate each bit; if it's '1', add the value of 2 raised to the corresponding power based on the bit's position to the cumulative total.
3. **Result Generation**: Output the final decimal value after processing all bits in the input.


```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String binaryString = "1001001"; // Example binary string
        int decimalValue = Converter.binToDecimal(binaryString);
        System.out.println("Decimal Value: " + decimalValue);
    }
}
```
